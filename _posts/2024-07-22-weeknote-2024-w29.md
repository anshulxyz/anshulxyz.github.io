- I've read Chapters 5 and 6 of the book 'Data Structures and Algorithms'
  by Wengrow. This section covers topics such as 'Selection Sort' and its
  efficiency.

- I started reading 'Beej's Guide to C Programming.' His writing style is very
  fun. So far, I've covered 'Variables and Statements,' 'Operators and
  Expressions,' 'Flow Control,' and 'Functions'—the first four chapters.

- Played 2 matches of football. <span class="muted">Lost 1. Drew 1.</span>
