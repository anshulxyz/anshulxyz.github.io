I am writing this on 2025-07-16, half of the year has gone by.
But half of the year is still there. Lets see what happens.

Following are the things I want to get done before 2025 ends.

At the end of the 2025, I will update this article with how much progress I made
on each topic.

## Priority
1. Squat 100 kg for 5 reps (at least)
1. Read "Elementary Linear Algebra" by Anton & Kaul
1. Read "Architecture Patterns with Python" by Percival & Gregory
1. Read "The Little Schemer" by Friedman & Felleisen
1. Read "... Data Structures and Algorithms" by Wengrow
1. Write an article on a topic from linear algebra.
1. Throw a party for baby's 1st birthday.

## Optional
1. Reach rank 18kyu in Go(the game), on OGS.
1. Overhead Press 50 kg for 1 rep.
1. Move this blog away from Jekyll.
