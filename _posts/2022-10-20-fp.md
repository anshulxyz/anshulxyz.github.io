- Functional programming: we construct programs using only _pure functions_. That is, functions that have no side effects.
- Pure function: A function $$f$$ with the input type $$A$$ and output type $$B$$ is a computation that relates every value $$a$$ of type $$A$$ to exactly one value $$b$$ of type $$B$$ such that $$b$$ is determined solely by the value of $$a$$. Think of an [injective function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injective_function)(one-to-one) in Mathematics.
- Side effects: modification of the _state_ outside of the local scope
- Referential transparency:  A piece of code is referentially transparent if we can safely replace that piece of code with the value it computes and vice-versa, anywhere where that piece is used, without changing the meaning or result of our program.
- Higher order function: functions that take other functions as arguments and may return a function as their output.
