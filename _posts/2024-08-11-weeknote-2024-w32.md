- Read through Chapters 7 and 8 of the book 'Data Structures and Algorithms' by
  Wengrow. This section covers topics of Hash Tables. I have also decided that
  I want to record my solutions to the Exercises. Which you can find at
  [wengrow2020]({{ "wengrow2020" | relative_url }}).

- Continued reading through "Beej's Guide to C Programming" and finished
  chapters (No.9 & 10) on File Input/Output and `typedef`.

- Created my first Mac OS app, that plays a 'ting' sound every 10 minutes. To
  give me a sense of time passing by.
