Earlier this year I finished a [physical challenge]({% post_url 2023-03-04-review-super-squats %}).

I want to see how far I will get if I studied Mathematics straight for 365 days.

Why? Because I've never been great at Maths, and I wanted to improve on that front. Because I believe this will build a habit of studying every day.

365 Days of Maths starts _today_ ({{ "2023-08-26" | date_to_string }}). Here are a few guidelines.

### Guidelines

- Each day I must solve at least one Maths problem. As long as I am able to get the correct answer (OR have at least spend an entire hour on the problem) it counts.
- Each day I must spend at least one hour.
- Day ends when I go to sleep, not at midnight.
- In case I miss a day (due to difficult circumstances) I am allowed to make up for it the next day.

### Documentation

I will update _this_ post with the progress.

### Stream
