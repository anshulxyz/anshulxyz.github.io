As of writing this post (2025-07-29), more than half of the year has passed.

1. Read "Book of Proof" by Richard Hammack.
1. Write a blog post on a topic from Linear Algebra.
1. Throw a party for kid's birthday.
1. Go to a tech conference.
1. Squat 100 kg
1. Deadlift 120 kg

## Optional
1. Read parts of "Elementary Linear Algebra" by Howard Anton
    1. "Determinants"
    1. "General Vector Spaces"
1. Read "C Programming Language".
