Hi! I am Anshul Chauhan. This is my personal website. By profession, I am a
software craftsman. Some of my interests outside of programming are:
<a href="https://x.com/anshulxyz/status/1865803780635447451" target="_blank">playing football</a>,
and playing <a href="{{ '/go-game' | url }}">Go</a>.
</p>

<p>
Here I plan to write just about anything that catches my fancy. To document
various things in life.
</p>

<p>
All opinions are my own and not a representation of my employers.
