- Why?
  - IndiaHikes requires you to run 5 km under 30 minutes *comfortably*.
  - \>Insert some stat from some scientific paper to scarethe public\<
  - Insert some benefits of running.
  - Insert peer pressure.
- What?
- How?
  - C25K, couch-to-5-km, is about going from being not-running to running 5km.


$$
\text{pace} = \frac{\text{time (minutes)}}{\text{distance (km)}}
$$

$$
\text{speed} = \frac{\text{distance (km)}}{\text{time (h)}}
$$

- I am not a runner. Never have been. I was always average at it.
- My speed was never great. For this reason I used to shy away from playing as a winger or a striker in football. But I knew I could run for longer duration. And I had good enough ball control. So I decided to play as a midfielder as much as possible.
- Now I play turf football on some weekdends.
- Playing football on weekends did improve my cardio a lot. It used to be utter
  s\*\*t. When I started playing football some months back I was unable to
  finish 1 hour of turf football.
- I Googled "c25k", and there were many templates, I chose a month long plan and started on 2022-10-28.
- first let's get into the data
