- IndiaHikes requires you to run 5 km under 30 minutes *comfortably*.
- C25K, couch-to-5-km, is about going from being not-running to running 5km.
- I am not a runner. I lift weight inconsistently. I do play turf football on some weekdends.
- Playing football on weekends did improve my cardio a lot. It used to be utter
  s\*\*t. When I started playing football some months back I was unable to
  finish 1 hour of turf football.
- I Googled "c25k", and there were many templates, I chose a month long plan and started on 2022-10-28.
