1. "Super Squats" by Randall J. Strossen. Refer [this post]({% post_url 2023-03-04-review-super-squats %}) for my _first_ experience with the program.

1. "A Common-Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms" by **Jay Wengrow**.
<span class="aside">This is an amazing book for people who wish to learn DS&A.</span>

1. This video essay "[Beauty Will Save the World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH7DKKBh_Ao)" introduced to the life of Dostoevsky. I had never read any work by him, and I decided to change that. From what I've heard of his works so far over the years gave me an impression that his works are philosophical and hard to work through. I decided to start with his short stories. First story I read is called "Mr Prohartchin".

1. "Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions" by Edwin A. Abbott

1. "Precalculus" by James Stewart.
