In the May of 2023 I went an island called Koh Samui, in Thaialnd, for a vacation.

This was my first time going on an international trip.

I am writing this post for my friends who wish to go on a similar trip and have never been abroad for a vacation.


Koh Samui is beautiful.

## Preparation

1. Get a passport.

1. Watch bunch of YouTube videos about the island. Get the general idea of the culture and environment there. Learn about their roads and traffic rules. Learn a little about the history of Thailand. I really like this channel called [Side Trip Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAnuxwqYYuA). His style of travelling is akin to mine. And less like an _influencer_.

1. Learn about the weather and seasons on the island. Visit [weatherspark.com - Koh Samui](https://weatherspark.com/y/112991/Average-Weather-in-Ko-Samui-Thailand-Year-Round).
Using this data decide the month you wish to visit in.

1. Go to [skyscanner.com]( https://www.skyscanner.co.in/ ) and find the best flights across the airlines that suits your requirements.

- excursions
- International Driver's License
- flight experience
- Apply for eVOA https://thailandevoa.vfsevisa.com/thailand/online/home/index

- Book a hotel for every night. You'll need these bookings to get the VISA, even
if you don't plan on being there. Even if you plan to take an overnight train.

- clothing

- food
  - vegetarians may have some problem of finding variety of local food
  - insert a fact about thai veg/non-veg ratio

- women's safety
- show a beautiful map from https://maps.stamen.com/#terrain
- show altitude because from the map it would seem flat, I was surprised to see
  the mountains.
