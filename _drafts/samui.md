# A 10-day itinerary for Koh Samui

In the early May-2023 I went to Koh Samui (in Thaialnd) for a vacation.
In the following post I hope to document every piece of info that I
would want to share with a friend if they wish to make a similar trip.

Ideal audience for the post is my past self, someone who has never
done an international trip.

**Disclaimer**: Don't use me as the primary source of critical information.
Alsways verify with official sources.

I am assuming you already have a valid passport.
