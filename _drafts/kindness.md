**Refactoring**

Refactoring as an act of kindness _towards your future-self and towards other developers_.

Refactoring is always overlooked in the process of delivering solutions and
meeting deadlines. It's always treated as an after-thought. But what if I can
reframe my thoughts about the act of refactoring.

I am across a beautiful tweet the other day.

Which is based on

But let's stick to programming for now.

These questions got me thinking.

How would I write code if I truly loved myself and my colleagues?
Would I cut corners? Would I not write tests? Would I not try my best?
