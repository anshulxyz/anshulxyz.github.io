- Working as a software developer fills most of my time.
- Doing [5/3/1](https://www.jimwendler.com/blogs/jimwendler-com/101065094-5-3-1-for-a-beginner) lifting program to get stronger.
- Learning Rust by doing [rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) execises, and making [videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLn-XEhD3IYYbc36oJdrGlJzVsG2szX6OE) about it.
- Building a Discord bot (in Rust) that gives verses of Dhammapada.
- Currently reading these books:
