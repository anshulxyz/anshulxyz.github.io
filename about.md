# About Me

Hi! I am Anshul Chauhan, a software craftsman from Pune, India.

I primarily code in Python, but I have recently been working with Java and
Kotlin for projects at work. I have also been learning Rust and trying to build
my side projects in it.

Beyond work, I am interested in cliff-jumping, fish-curry, playing football,
and trekking.

What I am doing [now]({% link now.md %}).
