# About Me

Hi! I am Anshul Chauhan, a software craftsman from Pune, India.

I primarily code in Python, but I have recently been working with Kotlin for
projects at work. Drop me a [mail](mailto:anshulchauhan@outlook.com) for any
new opportunities.

Beyond work, I am interested in cliff-jumping, fish-curry, playing football,
and trekking.
